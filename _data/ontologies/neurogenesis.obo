name: MAPK cascade
namespace: biological_process
def: "An intracellular protein kinase cascade containing at least a MAPK, a MAPKK and a MAP3K. The cascade can also contain two additional tiers: the upstream MAP4K and the downstream MAP Kinase-activated kinase (MAPKAPK). The kinases in each tier phosphorylate and activate the kinases in the downstream tier to transmit a signal within a cell." [GOC:bf, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11, PMID:20811974, PMID:9561267]
comment: MAPK cascades lie downstream of many cell surface receptors and cooperate in transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus. One way by which the specificity of each cascade is regulated is through the existence of several distinct components in each tier of the different cascades. The cascades are typically named according to the component in the MAPK tier.

def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

comment: In GO, a gene product with 'vascular endothelial growth factor-activated receptor activity ; GO:0005021' necessarily binds VEGF to transduce a signal. To represent cross-talk between ligands and receptors, signaling pathways in GO are starting to be named after the receptor and/or the signal. GO:0038084 is for annotation of any pathway in which the ligand VEGF binds and activates any cell surface receptor (VEGFR, PDGFR etc.). For annotation of signaling pathways where a VEGFR binds one of its physiological ligands (VEGF or an alternative growth factor), consider 'vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway ; GO:0048010'.
